        It's the craft that is on the exact intersection between creativity and
        skill expression that scratches that itch in the back of my mind.

        <p>
          This training gave me practical, industry-ready skills and confirmed
          my passion for software development, particularly the problem-solving
          aspects of backend work and systems integration.
        </p>
        <p>Core technologies and skills developed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <u><em>Backend & APIs</em></u
            >: Developed RESTful APIs, worked with relational databases (SQL),
            and built practical automation tools including Discord and Telegram
            bots.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u><em>Programming foundations</em></u
            >: Started with Java for core concepts (OOP, data structures,
            algorithms, memory management), then expanded to Python for dynamic
            typing and rapid prototyping. Learnt and used git for collaborative
            development all throughout the course, too.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u><em>System administration</em></u
            >: Completed entire program on a self-installed and configured Linux
            distribution, developing comfort with command-line tools and
            system-level operations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u><em>Mobile development</em></u
            >: Built Android applications using Kotlin and Android Studio,
            learning the full development lifecycle from UI design to
            deployment.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Computer Science Degree - Universidad da Coruña (2018-2020, resumed
          2025)
        </p>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <p>
          Currently completing my degree to build stronger theoretical
          foundations and fill knowledge gaps from vocational training.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working in the industry for a few years, I've realized how
          important it is to understand the *why* behind the tools and
          techniques I use daily. The degree is helping me become a more
          thoughtful, well-rounded developer.
        </p>
        <p>What I'm gaining:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em><u>Mathematical rigor</u></em
            >: Deep dives into discrete mathematics, linear algebra, calculus,
            and statistics. Currently working through Sheldon Axler's *Linear
            Algebra Done Right* to strengthen my mathematical foundations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em><u>Low-level systems</u></em
            >: Working with C, assembly language, and computer architecture to
            understand how software actually runs on hardware.
          </li>
          <li>
            <u><em>Advanced concepts</em></u
            >: Design patterns, concurrent programming, different programming
            paradigms, and algorithmic analysis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em><u>Broader perspective</u></em
            >: Electronic technology, formal logic, and computational theory.
          </li>
